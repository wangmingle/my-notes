chrome helper memory

If you open the Activity Monitor and see that a process called "google chrome helper" is using too much CPU, here's how I fixed it:

I went to Chrome settings/content settings/Plugins and selected Click To Play for all plugins.  (The default is Run Automatically.)

This fixed my problem.  Now you have to click whenever you want to run a youtube video or other plugins, but it's worth it.  It stops those stupid Flash ads from loading, too, so that's an extra bonus.

I'm posting this because when I had the problem, I couldn't find any solutions at all.

Craig...go to Chrome > preferences > settings > show advanced settings > content settings (under privacy)

Then click the 'click to play' button under the Plugins section.

Click done when you are finished.
