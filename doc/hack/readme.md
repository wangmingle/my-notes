 Clearnet is a term typically referring to the unencrypted, or non-darknet, non-Tor internet.[1][2] This traditional world wide web has relatively low-base anonymity, with most websites routinely identifying users by their IP address.[3]

The term has been used synonymously with the non-traditional search engine indexable surface web due to the historical overlap when darknets were all a part of the deep web.[4]


### surface web

 The Surface Web (also called the Visible Web, Clearnet, Indexed Web, Indexable Web or Lightnet,[1]) is that portion of the World Wide Web that is readily available to the general public and searchable with standard web search engines. It is the opposite of the deep web.[2]

 According to one source, as of June 14, 2015, Google's index of the surface web contains about 14.5 billion pages
